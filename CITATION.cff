  The System Hardware ID Generator Script is a Python tool designed
  to generate a unique Hardware ID (HWID) for the device it runs on.
  The HWID is represented as an 18-digit integer, making it efficient
  for storage in databases and indexing. This script can be used in 
  various applications such as software licensing, device
  authentication, and hardware inventory management.
